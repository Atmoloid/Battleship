It seems that some of the file retrievals failed. However, I did manage to retrieve the content of the `index.html` file. I will proceed with drafting the README using the available information. We may need to manually check the remaining files later.

## Introduction
Battleship is a popular game where players try to sink each other's ships on a grid. This project is a web-based implementation of the game, allowing players to play against an AI opponent.

## Setup and Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Atmoloid/Battleship.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Battleship
    ```
3. Open `index.html` in your web browser to start the game.

## Code Breakdown
### index.html
The main HTML structure for the game interface:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="eng">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
    <title>Battleship</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>BATTLESHIP</h1>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="grid" id="playerGrid"></div>
        <h3 id="player">YOU</h3>
        <div class="grid" id="enemyGrid"></div>
        <h3 id="enemy">ENEMY</h3>
    </div>
    <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```
- The HTML file sets up the basic structure and links to the CSS and JavaScript files.

### CSS and JavaScript Files
- `styles.css`: Contains the styling for the game interface.
- `main.js`, `game.js`, `board.js`, `ship.js`: These files likely contain the main game logic, board setup, and ship functionalities. Unfortunately, I was unable to retrieve the contents of these files.

## Usage
1. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
2. Play the game by placing your ships and taking turns to attack the enemy grid.
